# My Threat Model

## 1.) Approach

The following model will address the possible threats, and my response to them,
resulting from leaving my laptop on a table in the SUB while I step away to take a phone call. It takes the format of:

* Potential Vulnerability
	
	(a) Protective measure 1
	
	(b) Protective measure 2
	
	etc...

My model is as follows, stemming primarily from a concern that someone malicious
might breach my computer's password:

* Someone observes me typing in my password/ someone deduces my password from
keys that are the most worn down.
	
	(a) Try to make sure no one sees my password while I type it in
	
	(b) Make a password which is long and has a wide variety of characters
	
	(c) Try to recognize when my keys may provide a recognizable pattern, and either change my passcode or clean my keyboard.

* Someone successfully breaches my passcode and can get into my computer
	
	(a) Disable automatic password saving (or use something like lastpass) to keep my passwords to everything else secure.
	
	(b) Don't have the same password for every account.
	
	(c) Maybe don't have my email/other accounts/icloud automatically signed in, protecting my personal data and messages, and keeping someone from messaging another person maliciously.

* Someone can't get into my computer, and they're so frustrated by my massive password that they throw my computer on the floor and then proceed to pour an entire bottle of soda on my computer... or something of that sort.

	(a) Hire somebody large and intimidating to look over my computer at all times.
	
	(b) Be sad that someone destroyed my computer, save up my money, and buy a new one. At least they didn't get into my bank account or something (one would hope).

* Someone gets into my computer, gets my passwords/information, but I don't realize or they don't use these assets right away.
	
	(a) This is probably the most challenging scenario, and it is also reasonably likely when compared to the other possibilities. One potential solution could be to regularly change your passwords, so that in the case that someone has your passwords somewhere, eventually they won't be useful anymore.

	(b) One could also use two-factor authentification. This would make it harder to get passwords if say, your messages weren't on for your laptop. Which brings up the point that you should turn off your text messages on your laptop.

* Someone is able to do something tricky to get into your computer without guessing your password (like somehow accessing things they shouldn't through bluetooth, or other possible network breaches).
	
	(a) The easiest, most rudimentary approach here could just be to put your computer in airplane mode. Though it may be unlikely that anyone sitting in the SUB has enough expertise to carry out such a complex attack, it is possible and one should always be prepared.

## 2.) (Reflection) Strengths of my approach

* Virtually all of these precautionary measures have a very low overhead. Meaning, aside from hiring someone to constantly watch my computer, or replacing that computer when it is destroyed by an evil stranger, all of these solutions are highly affordable, both in terms of monetary cost and effort.

* My solutions address both the threat of an attack in the moment, and potential courses of action after someone is able to breach my system. In this regard, even if my main plan fails (keeping someone out of my computer), there are still options to fall back on to hopefully keep them away from the most damaging things they could do.


## 3.) (Reflection) Weaknesses of my approach

* I used a brainstorming approach, which is limited to only what I personally can come up with.

* If someone is able to successfully break in to all of my accounts after accessing my computer, I don't have much of a plan in the immediate future thereafter. I'll change my passwords eventually and use two-factor authentification, but this doesn't provide any great options if say, my bank account were accessed and money was able to quickly get stolen. I wouldn't be getting that money back.

* My approach doesn't deal at all with someone accessing a laptop via facial recognition or fingerprint software. I'm not sure how difficult this is to fabricate, but I don't have much of a plan to prevent potential vulnerabilities in this regard.


## 4.) (Reflection) Areas for improvement

* I don't have much of a plan for if someone were to just simply damage my hardware. My only options are pretty expensive and time consuming.

* I could try one of the rigorous, well established threat models used in the field instead of my simple brainstorming approach.

* I should also try and think about other potential areas for trouble in a laptop. Perhaps most glaringly, access to a camera. I don't have any plan if this were to occur. (Though just covering up my camera with a sticky note could be a good course of action. But with so many zoom meetings going on, this is increasingly unlikely in my life at least.)
