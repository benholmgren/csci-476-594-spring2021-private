# My Threat Model

The following model will address the possible threats, and my response to them,
resulting from leaving my laptop on a table in the SUB while I step away to take a phone call. It takes the format of:

* Potential Vulnerability
	(a) Protective measure 1
	(b) Protective measure 2
	etc...

My model is as follows, stemming primarily from a concern that someone malicious
might breach my computer's password:

* Someone observes me typing in my password/ someone deduces my password from
keys that are the most worn down.
	(a) Try to make sure no one sees my password while I type it in
	(b) Make a password which is long and has a wide variety of characters
	(c) Try to recognize when my keys may provide a recognizable pattern,
and either change my passcode or clean my keyboard.

* Someone successfully breaches my passcode and can get into my computer
	(a) Disable automatic password saving (or use something like lastpass)
to keep my passwords to everything else secure.
	(b) Don't have the same password for every account.
	(c) Maybe don't have my email/other accounts/icloud automatically signed in, protecting my personal data and messages, and keeping someone from messaging another person maliciously.
