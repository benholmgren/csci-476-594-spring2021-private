### Task 1.1

md5collgen -p prefix.txt -o out1.bin out2.bin

Running the provided commands, we observe that the prefix remained at the start
of both out1.bin and out2.bin, and the rest of the contents of the files
were nearly the same, though they both contained a couple of changes.

### Task 1.2

It will be padded with zeros.

### Task 1.3

There will be no padding, so no zeros all over creation.

### Task 1.4

No, not all bytes differ. Not only that, but when we run this numerous times,
we find that the differences are not constant.

### Task 2.1
